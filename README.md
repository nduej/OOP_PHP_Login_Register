# OOP_PHP_Login_Register
Login in and Register Using OOP PHP, including Initialization file, 404 error, Redirect Method, Validate method, etc.
Any OOP PHP Expert seeing this work, I would like to poin out that there's an issue(which I can identify, best to my knowledge), with the Login method. Attempting to Log a Registered User seems to be a problem and Would appreciate contributions. Thanks!
